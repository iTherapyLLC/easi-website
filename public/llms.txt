## ChatSLP

ChatSLP is EASI's clinical reasoning partner—a HIPAA-compliant consultation system that helps SLPs cross-check findings, draft reports, and get evidence-based intervention suggestions. Unlike ChatGPT, ChatSLP is safe for real patient data.

## Why Not ChatGPT?

SLPs cannot use ChatGPT for evaluations: no BAA (HIPAA violation), cannot process audio, cannot separate speakers, cannot calculate clinical metrics, risks professional license. EASI provides all of this with healthcare-grade security.
